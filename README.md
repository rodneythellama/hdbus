# hdbus -- haskell bindings for d-bus

"[D-Bus][0] is a message bus system, a simple way for applications to talk
to one another." It's particularly popular on free software desktops
(Gnome, KDE). For example, on my recent Ubuntu system, these bindings
are sufficient to pop up balloon-tip-style notifications via a daemon
I wasn't previously aware of.

Read [the documentation][2] online.

This repo is a copy of the [original][1] which has mostly fallen
offline. Minor changes have been added to make it build with GHC 7.x.
