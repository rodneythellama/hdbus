HDBus -- Haskell bindings for D-Bus.
Copyright (C) 2006 Evan Martin <martine@danga.com>

== About
"D-Bus is a message bus system, a simple way for applications to talk to one
another."  It's particularly popular on free software desktops (Gnome, KDE).
See http://www.freedesktop.org/wiki/Software/dbus for details.

== Installation
You must have the D-Bus headers and libraries installed.
Install on Debian-based systems with:
  apt-get install libdbus-1-dev
Check your installation with:
  pkg-config --modversion dbus-1

The module code is in module/, and it's the standard series of cabal steps:
  runhaskell Setup.lhs configure
  runhaskell Setup.lhs build
  runhaskell Setup.lhs install

== How to Use it
See demo/Demo.hs for some example calls.

== License
BSD.  See module/LICENSE for details.
